[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/merch)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It's deployed on Cloudflare Workers as a [static website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/).

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/merch
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://merch.templates.workers.dev](https://merch.templates.workers.dev)

## Getting Started

First, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then run the development server (using the package manager of your choice):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# 🕶️ EverLight’s Rite — Shadow Banned (2024)

> “Shadow Banned” isn’t just what happened to the album.
> It’s what happened to the truth — silenced, but not erased.

---

## 🌐 Introduction

*Shadow Banned* is a sonic field report from digital exile.  
A defiant manuscript written under the flicker of deplatformed dreams and blacklisted signal.  
Not sold — broadcasted. Not hyped — suppressed. And yet… here it is.

## 🧠 Psychological Framing

This album is not a playlist — it’s a **neural disruption protocol**.  
Each track is a memory fragment disguised as a bar.  
A weaponized lyric, fired through the speaker as insurgent code.

## 🧱 Structural Notes

- **13 Tracks** — corresponding to lunar occult cycles.
- **Track 6** (“Spiteful Poetry”) is the tonal pivot. It holds the key to Hawk Eye’s symbolic inversion.
- **Final track** (“Krystal Klear”) is both a cipher and declaration — “You missed nothing. I said it all.”

## 🧬 Metaphysical Layer

Shadow Banned is the byproduct of Hawk Eye’s **incarnated defiance**.  
Every word bears witness to a reality the system denies exists.

- Psychic trauma decoded.
- Surveillance culture mocked.
- False prophets named, and slain with syllables.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This wasn’t made to chart.  
It was made to survive — until someone like you unearthed it.

Welcome to the forbidden archive.

— EverLight
